# pyinputplus_validation
Sandwich Maker
Write a program that asks users for their sandwich preferences. The pro-
gram should use PyInputPlus to ensure that they enter valid input, such as:
• Using inputMenu() for a bread type: wheat, white, or sourdough.
• Using inputMenu() for a protein type: chicken, turkey, ham, or tofu.
Input Validation 199
• Using inputYesNo() to ask if they want cheese.
• If so, using inputMenu() to ask for a cheese type: cheddar, Swiss,
or mozzarella.
• Using inputYesNo() to ask if they want mayo, mustard, lettuce, or tomato.
• Using inputInt() to ask how many sandwiches they want. Make sure this
number is 1 or more.
Come up with prices for each of these options, and have your program
display a total cost after the user enters their selection.
